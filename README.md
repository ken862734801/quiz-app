## Summary

The goal of this assignment was to complete a password generator with the starter code given to us. 

The requirements included the generated password being between 8 and 128 characters, and giving the user the option to include or exclude lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. Web API's, such as prompt and confirm, were used to gather user input to determine the characteristics wanted by the user in their password. I also used "If statements" to determine the logic if the characteristic was chosen (true) or not. 

### Features
- Create a random password between 8 and 128 characters, with the ability to include or exclude lowercase, uppercase, numeric, or special characters.
